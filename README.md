# Arduino Smart Garden Project

This repo documents my adventures creating an arduino-based watering system for my plants ðŸŒ±

The project uses:

- Arduino UNO (AVR REV 3 SMD). [Pin diagram](https://content.arduino.cc/assets/Pinout-UNOrev3SMD_latest.pdf). [Buy](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3-smd)
- NodeMCU ESP8266 12-E Kit. [Pin diagram](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-pinout-reference-gpios/). [Buy](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-NodeMcu-Internet-Development-ESP8266/dp/B08F7HNGRT)
- Capacitive soil humidity sensor
- Dupont cables
- Some soldering (could be avoided)

> Please do note using an arduino uno ***and*** an ESP8266 12-E Kit is overkill, but that's what I ended up using for this project

## The concept
The objective is to create a smart watering system that can periodically water plants given an external signal (soil humidity sensor), and send out notifications detailing the plants' conditions, and whether or not the reservoir needs to be refilled.

### *Sensing and watering*
The sensing is performed using a capacitive soil moisture sensor, which was calibrated, and later read by the Arduino, which will determine if a valve or motor needs to be triggered

### *Notifying*
The data from the arduino is sent using the [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/wire/) library to the NodeMCU chip, which has a wifi chip (this could be avoided using a Wifi-enabled arduino), and this sends out a request to a [Google Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions).

This Cloud Function stores the data in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), and decides if sending out a notification is required. This can be done over email, IFTTT push notifications, whatsapp, or other. 

> The data in BigQuery is stored indefinitely so it can later be analized traditionally, or as part of a future Machine Learning project
